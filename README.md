# stockmarketSimulation
// This program uses the vector class from the vector library 
// to store the stocks in a collection. It also defines a Stock 
// class that represents a single stock. The Stock class has four 
// properties: name, price, volatility, and dividends. The updatePrice() 
// method is used to update the stock's price based on a random price change and a market factor.
